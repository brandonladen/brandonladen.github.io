# **ImageSearch**

* This is a web-based application that facilitates the identification of missing children through facial recognition.
* It has a user interface as well as API endpoint.
* Users can submit details of missing children to a centralized database, when a child is reported missing.
* By uploading an image to the search page, Users are able to search through the database to look for similar children. Utilizing opensource Image Recognition Models(i.e Facenet) available in the [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) library.

NB: The image used below is just a random image from the internet and the details are also NOT REAL, I just guessed for demonstration purposes.
